Yes, absolutely! You **can apply a JOIN without any primary or foreign key constraint**. SQL joins work based on matching values in columns — the database does not require formal constraints for the JOIN to work.

Here’s a simple example:

### Tables:
```sql
-- Table: employees
+----+------------+
| id | name       |
+----+------------+
| 1  | Alice      |
| 2  | Bob        |
| 3  | Charlie    |
+----+------------+

-- Table: departments
+----+--------------+
| emp_name | dept   |
+----------+--------+
| Alice    | HR     |
| Bob      | Sales  |
+----------+--------+
```

Note: No foreign key or primary key defined between `employees` and `departments`.

### Join Query Without Foreign/Primary Keys:
```sql
SELECT 
    employees.name, 
    departments.dept 
FROM 
    employees 
JOIN 
    departments 
ON 
    employees.name = departments.emp_name;
```

✔️ This query will still work — it matches rows where `employees.name = departments.emp_name`.

So, the **main idea** is:  
👉 You just need a logical relationship between the columns you're joining — formal keys are optional unless you're enforcing referential integrity.


Great question, Sejal! Here's the simple and honest breakdown:

### 💡 **Does having Primary and Foreign Keys make JOINs faster?**

✅ **Yes — slightly faster in many cases.**  
But more importantly:

> 🔐 **They ensure data integrity** and help the **query optimizer** make better decisions.

---

### 💬 Here's why:

#### ✅ If you **have primary & foreign keys**:
- The **database engine knows** there's a guaranteed one-to-one or one-to-many relationship.
- It can **optimize joins better** (e.g., using indexes).
- Queries may be **faster**, especially on **large datasets**.

#### ❌ If you **don't have keys**:
- SQL still works fine — but:
  - No guaranteed data accuracy.
  - Database engine may use slower execution plans.
  - Joins may be slower **if no indexes are involved**.

---

### ⚡ Real-World Example:

```sql
-- With keys:
JOIN orders ON customers.id = orders.customer_id
-- Optimized using indexes created on primary/foreign keys.

-- Without keys:
JOIN orders ON customers.name = orders.customer_name
-- Slower if no index on "name", and more prone to mismatch.
```

### 🔧 Performance Tip:
Even if you **don’t use constraints**, adding **indexes manually** on the columns you JOIN can help a lot with performance!
